# OpenTable-app-ASP.net-Core-MVC-

Built a full-stack internet application using ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 9) and Entity Framework Core following a Model-First approach, simulating a real-world platform similar to OpenTable.com.

- Implemented multi-area architecture, regular and attribute routing, model binding, Post/Redirect/Get (PRG) pattern, session and cookie management, and custom server- and client-side validations.
- Integrated repository pattern and .NET Identity services for robust data access and authentication/authorization.
- Applied Bootstrap 5 and jQuery for responsive front-end design, with features including user/admin navigation, shopping cart functionality, advanced filtering, pagination, and sorting.
- Developed secure administrator functionalities for CRUD operations on metropolises, restaurants, and user entitlements.
- Leveraged Visual Studio Code with Command Line Interface (CLI) for efficient development and deployment workflows. Prioritized modern design patterns, secure coding practices, and cloud-readiness throughout the project.
